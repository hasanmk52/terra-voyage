		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Project Setup and Infrastructure Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup into specific configuration steps: Next.js 15 initialization, TypeScript configuration, TailwindCSS setup, Shadcn UI installation, Prisma ORM setup, PostgreSQL database configuration, environment variables setup, Vercel deployment pipeline, package installations, folder structure creation, Git repository initialization, and .gitignore configuration. Each subtask should be independently testable and completable.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple technology integrations and configurations that are foundational but relatively straightforward. The complexity comes from ensuring all components work together correctly, but each individual setup step is well-documented and standard."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Database Schema Design and User Authentication",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide this into database design and authentication implementation: Prisma schema design with all models and relationships, database migration setup, NextAuth.js configuration with Google OAuth, custom authentication pages creation, user profile API routes implementation, and database indexing for performance. Focus on security best practices and data integrity.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to critical security implications, complex relationships between models, OAuth integration challenges, and the foundational nature of authentication for the entire application. Requires careful consideration of data privacy and security standards."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Landing Page and User Onboarding Flow",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into UI/UX focused subtasks: hero section design and implementation, sample itinerary showcase components, testimonials section, onboarding flow wireframing, progressive disclosure implementation, form validation setup, and animation integration. Emphasize responsive design and user experience optimization.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity focused on frontend development and user experience. While technically straightforward, requires good design sense and attention to user flow optimization. The onboarding flow needs careful UX consideration but uses standard form handling patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Trip Planning Form and Input Validation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into form components and validation: Google Places API integration for destination autocomplete, custom date range picker implementation, traveler selection interface, budget configuration with currency support, interest categories multi-select, travel preferences form, Zod validation schemas, form state management, and progress indicator implementation.",
			"reasoning": "High-medium complexity due to multiple API integrations, complex form state management across steps, real-time validation requirements, and the need for excellent UX in a multi-step process. Google Places API integration adds external dependency complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "AI Itinerary Generation Engine",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into AI integration and optimization components: OpenAI/Claude API integration setup, custom prompt engineering for itinerary generation, JSON response parsing and validation, Redis caching implementation, fallback system with curated data, budget calculation algorithms, and performance optimization for sub-30 second generation times.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity due to AI integration challenges, prompt engineering requirements, performance optimization needs, fallback system implementation, and the critical nature of generating high-quality, personalized results. Requires extensive testing and fine-tuning."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Interactive Maps Integration with Routing",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure around mapping features: Mapbox GL JS integration and configuration, custom marker system for different activity types, route optimization using Directions API, transportation mode implementation, map controls and interaction features, and performance optimization with clustering and lazy loading.",
			"reasoning": "High-medium complexity due to third-party mapping API integration, performance optimization requirements for smooth user experience, complex routing algorithms, and the need to handle various transportation modes. Requires careful attention to mobile performance."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Itinerary Customization and Management Interface",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Focus on interactive UI components: drag-and-drop implementation with @dnd-kit, activity CRUD operations with modal interfaces, timeline view component, schedule update algorithms, activity suggestion system, undo/redo functionality, and optimistic UI updates for real-time feel.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to sophisticated user interactions, drag-and-drop implementation challenges, complex state management for real-time updates, and the need for smooth UX with optimistic updates. The undo/redo system adds additional complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Weather Integration and Activity Recommendations",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize around weather features: OpenWeatherMap API integration, weather-aware activity filtering logic, packing list generation algorithms, weather alert system, weather display components, and caching strategy implementation for API optimization.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity with straightforward API integration but requiring intelligent recommendation algorithms. The challenge lies in creating meaningful weather-based suggestions and managing API rate limits effectively."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Collaboration and Sharing Features",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down by collaboration features: trip sharing system with email invitations, permission level implementation, real-time collaborative editing with WebSockets/SSE, voting system for group decisions, comment system, notification system, conflict resolution mechanisms, and activity approval workflows.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity due to real-time collaboration requirements, complex permission systems, conflict resolution challenges, and the need for robust notification systems. WebSocket implementation and concurrent editing present significant technical challenges."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Pricing Integration and Booking Links",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure around pricing and booking: Amadeus API integration for flights, Booking.com API integration for hotels, real-time price update system with caching, price alert implementation with background jobs, affiliate tracking system, and price comparison interface development.",
			"reasoning": "High-medium complexity due to multiple external API integrations, real-time data requirements, affiliate tracking implementation, and the need for accurate price comparison. Background job processing adds infrastructure complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Export and Offline Features",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into export and offline capabilities: PDF generation with Puppeteer and custom templates, calendar integration for multiple platforms, shareable link system, offline caching strategy, progressive web app implementation, and timezone conversion handling.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity with multiple integration points but well-established patterns. PDF generation and PWA implementation require specific technical knowledge, but the overall scope is manageable with clear deliverables."
